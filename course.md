## Welcome to Learn Python!

Python is an amazing language for beginners and experts alike. 
Its clear syntax and many extending components (called modules) 
make it easy for beginners to grasp and versatile enough to adapt
to almost any use case. In this web course, we'll show you the 
basics of Python, so you can get a foundation to make your own 
cool projects.

## What makes this course differnet from other courses?

There are many other books and courses on learning Python, one of the best being [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)
, by Al Sweigart. Like this course, it's free to view online, and does an excellent job of teaching Python using practical projects. However, 
unlike the book, this course has __*interactive*__ examples and editable code snippets, so you can really see how the examples work by running
them and modifying them. 

## How to use this course

Each chapter of the course teaches one concept of Python, such as lists, looops, or functions. You'll be introduced to what the concept is, 
and how to write it in Python.You can also see an example program to really understand how the concept is applied. 

After the reading and the examples, you'll be given a series of exercises to work 
through. Each exercise tests your knowledge of the concept. We __*highly*__ recommend 
doing the exercises, even if you're not completely ure how to complete them. All the exercises 
have soutions, so if you do get stuck, you can see the solution to get some help.

Finally, after the exercises, comes the fun part. You'll be provided with a prompt to 
solve a real-world problem, such as making a calculator. To do this, you'll need to combine all the skills you've 
learned from previous chapters. These are designed to be challenging, so don't worry  if you can't get them on your 
first try. If you want, you can always come beack to the challenges after you've finished the course and try them again.
